barton-unit-circle
==================

This is a javascript and HTML5 animation of a radius sweeping around a
unit circle, tracing sine and cosine waves.

See the animation [here](http://htmlpreview.github.com/?https://github.com/bartonski/barton-unit-circle/master/unit_circle.html).

In high school, I took trigonometry as part of a precalculus class. At the
time, I never felt that I had as good a mental model of the relationship
between the unit circle and the sine and cosine waves as I wanted,
so I put together this animation.
